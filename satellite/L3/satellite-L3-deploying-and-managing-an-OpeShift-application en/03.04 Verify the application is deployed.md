At this point, the application should be identically deployed to both the development and production clusters. This can be verified by looking at the OpenShift console for the development cluster running at the IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS and the cluster running in IBM Cloud.

1.  Open the IBM Cloud portal to the Clusters: <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/clusters" target="_blank">https://cloud.ibm.com/satellite/clusters</a>.

2. Click the **##SATELLITE.clustername##** link.

3. Click the **Manage cluster** button.

This will open a new browser window or tab to the cluster's overview page in the IBM Cloud portal.

4. Click the **OpenShift web console** button.

This will open a new browser window or tab to the OpenShift web console for the cluster.

5. If the **Developer** persona is not already selected, click the **Administrator** pull down menu and select **Developer**.

6. If not already selected, select the **##CONFIGURATION.namespace##** project from the **Topology** view.

**Note:** The image capture below is different than what you will see. Be sure and select the project (namespace) created for you: **##CONFIGURATION.namespace##**

7. Verify all the **Deployments** for the Food Delivery application are present.

**Note:** The image capture below may differ slightly from what you see. It is important to point out the **Deployments** represented here were all created from the **Subscriptions** to the various **Versions** you created for the **Configuration**. Notice that some of the **Deployments** have routes added to them. Routes are depicted by the ![](_attachments/routeIcon.png).

8. Verify the application frontend is accessed by clicking the route icon ![](_attachments/routeIcon.png) for the **example-food** deployment.

A new browser window or tab should be opened to the Food Delivery frontend.

9. Explore the Food Delivery application.

Start simulating orders into the system by clicking the **START** button. Notice the orders being received and fulfilled in the graph on lower right of the interface. These values represent orders moving through ordering to fulfillment. You can adjust the rate that orders are processed as well has the rate of kitchen time and delivery services.

**Note:** You may experience a delay in the application reporting orders being fulfilled.  This usually occurs when the demonstration environment is experiencing heavy usage. Remember, the demonstration is about the deployment and management of the application, and not the application functionality. If you experience orders only being received and not fulfilled, you can either continue to wait or just continue with the demonstration.

10. Repeat steps 2 thru 9 for the production environment cluster: **##OPENSHIFT-CLUSTER.clustername##**.
