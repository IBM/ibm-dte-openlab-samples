Below is a 12-minute video that covers this demonstration. The video is based on the steps described in the subsequent sections of this demonstration guide.  Callouts and some animations have been included. The screen splitting techniques are recommended, especially if you are doing your demonstration via a web conference. If you have multiple monitors, try putting the demonstration guide browser window on one monitor, and the IBM Cloud portal browser pages on another. During the web conference, just share the monitor with the IBM Cloud portal.
