Now that you have gone through all the steps, it is time to:
- Practice demonstrating it yourself using the demonstration guide.
- Review the video recording of the demonstration in [Section 01.04](gotoLink|01.04). 
- Try recording a video of your own demo. 

Is your video better than the one in [Section 01.04](gotoLink|01.04)? Did you customize it?

You are welcome to use this environment for quick client demonstrations.  However, if you need an environment that is longer running or a dedicated environment to customize for your client, leverage the IBM Cloud Satellite demonstration using the IBM TechZone collection: ***Setup an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS***, which can be found <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/SetupIBMCloudSatelliteLocationInAWS" target ="_blank">here</a>. 

Be sure to return to the Your Learning plan for IBM Cloud Satellite and mark this task as complete <a href="https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-37F924EAF756" target="_blank">here</a> **THIS LINK NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WHEN L3 PLAN EXISTS**. We would also greatly appreciate feedback on this demonstration. Please rate and leave comments in Your Learning.
