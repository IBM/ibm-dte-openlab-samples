With Satellite Link endpoints, you can allow software that runs in your Satellite location to connect to a service, server, or application that runs outside of the Satellite Location. Links can also allow software that is connected to the IBM Cloud private network to connect to a service, server, or application that runs in your Satellite Location.

To establish the connection, you must specify the destination resource's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address, port, the connection protocol, and any authentication methods at the endpoint. The endpoint is registered with the Satellite Link component of your Location's Satellite control plane. To help you maintain enterprise security and audit compliance, Satellite Link additionally provides built-in controls to restrict client access to endpoints, and to log and audit traffic that flows over endpoints.

Satellite Links are not used in these demonstrations but are an important concept to understand. For more information on Links, read the documentation <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-link-location-cloud" target="_blank">here</a>.
