Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) are available for IBM Cloud Satellite. In this section, explore the CLI capabilities related to IBM Cloud Satellite Locations. You can learn more about all the IBM Cloud Satellite CLIs <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-satellite-cli-reference" target="_blank">here</a>. When doing client demonstrations, it is important to understand who is in your audience. Performing demonstrations of CLIs to a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO) may not be well received; however, this type of demonstration may resonate well with other audiences like members of the IT staff, line-of-business developers, and others. These audiences will want to know that CLIs exist to perform the IBM Cloud Satellite tasks as they will probably want to further automate them in their deployments.

The terminal you see to the right of this lab guide is running on a virtual server in IBM Cloud. The IBM Cloud CLI has already been installed as well as the CLI plug-ins required by IBM Cloud Satellite. You can learn how to do these installs <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-setup-cli" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Note:** If this is your first time using this demonstration environment, refer to the [Using the lab guide](gotoLink|01.03) chapter for information on the **copy** and **execute** boxes that are used below.

1.  Log into IBM Cloud with your account. Select the **##ACCOUNT.name##** account, not your personal account. If prompted to specify a region, select **##SATELLITE.region##**.

```execute
ibmcloud login 
```

**Note:** If your account is configured with federated ID, you need to use the --sso option:

```execute
ibmcloud login --sso 
```

If you are not immediately prompted to select an account, you might need to acquire a one-time passcode from IBM Cloud. The sample output below shows that process. You will need to:

    - copy and paste the link into a new browser window
    - copy the one-time passcode from the browser page
    - paste it at the One Time Code prompt in the terminal
    - select the ##ACCOUNT.name## account

For example: 

```
container-lab$ ibmcloud login --sso
API endpoint: https://cloud.ibm.com
Region: us-south

Get One Time Code from https://identity-2.us-south.iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/passcode to proceed.
Open the URL in the default browser? [Y/n] > Y
One Time Code >
Authenticating...
OK

Select an account:
1. Andrew's Account (934360f4a07b734c569d05a94f71816e) <-> 1253879
2. ITZ - CLOUD (aeb2e9f6f29f41b99ce8e98c1c73e611) <-> 2029624   
Enter a number> 2
 ```
 
 If you are prompted that there is a new version of the IBM Cloud CLI is available, enter **n** (No) at the prompt.

2. List the IBM Cloud Satellite Locations.

```execute
ibmcloud sat locations
```

Sample output:

**Note:** Occasionally, the above command may time out with a "FAILED: Could not complete request" message.  Try running the command again.

5. Get the details for a specific host.

**Note:** you will need to replace the string **HOSTNAME** with the name of one of the hosts (for example "ip-10-0-1-17") from the previous command.

```copycommand
ibmcloud sat host get --location ##SATELLITE.location## --host HOSTNAME
```

All the commands executed above are commands that list or view the details of an IBM Cloud Satellite object. There are also commands to create, remove, and modify these objects. You will perform these types of actions in a later demonstration. 

**Note:** In this demonstration environment, you do not have permissions to add, remove or change Locations or Hosts.
