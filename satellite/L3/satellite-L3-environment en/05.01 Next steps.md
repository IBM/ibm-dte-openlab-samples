In this demonstration, you learned how to provision an IBM Cloud Satellite Location in AWS, and how to use the IBM Cloud Satellite application programming interfaces (APIs).

As a next step, think about how you would demonstrate this capability to your client. Remember, several options were suggested in [Demonstrate: How to provision a Location](gotoLink|02.03).  Keep in mind, demonstrating this capability does not necessarily illustrate the value proposition of IBM Cloud Satellite as you learned in your Level 2 training; however, it may appeal to more technical audiences. Make sure you consider your audience when you plan your demonstration.

In the next demonstration, you will learn how to deploy an IBM Cloud service to an IBM Cloud Satellite Location (COMING SOON). And in the third demonstration, you will learn how to show your clients one of the true powers of IBM Cloud Satellite: [Deploying and managing an OpenShift application using IBM Cloud Satellite configs](gotoLink|01.01|satellite-L3-deploying-and-managing-an-OpenShift-application).
